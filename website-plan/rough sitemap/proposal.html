      This website will be about the Babson Softball team. The objective is to
      share information about the team stats and individual player stats. It
      will include game film of cool plays or funny 'bloopers'. My target
      audience will be other coaches or players in D3 athletics to see what our
      team is like. I think pages will be Meet the players, Videos, Stats,
      TRAITS (which is our team culture.)
